Legal Definitions & Coverage Clauses
**Covered Person:** You, your resident relatives, or anyone using your insured vehicle with permission.
**Covered Vehicle:** Any automobile listed on the declarations page, or any temporary substitute.

**Subrogation:** Upon payment of a claim, we assume your rights to recover damages from third parties.
**Arbitration:** Any unresolved dispute under the Uninsured Motorist coverage shall be submitted to binding arbitration under AAA rules.
________________


ENDORSEMENT LANGUAGE
**MEGA-GA001**
This endorsement modifies the insurance provided under the Georgia Personal Auto Policy. All references to mandatory coverages shall conform to the minimum requirements as established by Georgia law. This includes minimum liability limits and uninsured motorist provisions.
**MEGA-UMSA1**
This endorsement modifies the policy to add uninsured motorist coverage that supplements, rather than substitutes for, the liability limits carried by an at-fault driver. Payment is available only after all other available bodily injury coverage is exhausted.
**MEGA-SDB14**
In the event of your first at-fault accident, this endorsement waives the surcharge typically associated with that claim, provided the policy has been in force for at least 36 months with no prior chargeable losses or violations.
**MEGA-RENTAL**
We will reimburse rental vehicle expenses up to the daily and total limits outlined on your declarations page for covered losses resulting in the inability to use your insured auto. A covered loss must be reported and acknowledged prior to reimbursement.
________________


POLICY CONDITIONS AND EXCLUSIONS
**Duties After an Accident or Loss**
You must notify us promptly. This includes the time, place, and circumstances of the incident, names and addresses of all involved, and cooperating fully with claims processing. Submit to examination under oath when requested. Provide proof of loss and allow us access to inspect any damaged property.
**Fraud or Misrepresentation**
This policy is void if, whether before or after a loss, you or any insured has intentionally concealed or misrepresented any material fact or circumstance relating to this insurance.
**Legal Action Against Us**
No legal action may be brought against us until there has been full compliance with all policy terms. Any action must commence within two (2) years of the date of loss. Where permitted, binding arbitration may be required prior to any legal filing.
**Use Restrictions**
This policy does not cover any vehicle while being used: (a) for delivery or ridesharing unless endorsed; (b) in organized racing or stunts; (c) while towing a trailer not owned by you; (d) in a war zone, riot, or civil disturbance.
________________


STATE-SPECIFIC AMENDATORY NOTICE – GEORGIA
This policy conforms to the requirements of Title 33 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated. Where any provision conflicts with state law, the terms shall be revised automatically to meet minimum statutory requirements. No coverage under this policy shall be construed to exceed that which is permitted by law.
Uninsured Motorist Coverage under this policy is governed by O.C.G.A. § 33-7-11 and shall be construed accordingly. Arbitration clauses may be invoked pursuant to the Georgia Arbitration Code where applicable.
________________


ENDORSEMENTS – CONTINUED

This endorsement excludes coverage for the individual named herein as a driver of any vehicle listed on this policy. No coverage applies for claims arising from accidents occurring while the excluded individual is operating a covered auto, regardless of circumstance or consent.
**MEGA-EFT23**
If you have elected to pay your premium via electronic funds transfer (EFT), this endorsement confirms a discount applied to your total premium. Cancellation due to failed EFT attempts may result in loss of the discount and retroactive billing.
**MEGA-MED05**
This endorsement provides Medical Payments coverage in accordance with selected limits. Coverage applies to reasonable and necessary medical expenses incurred within three years of an accident, regardless of fault.
**MEGA-ROADSIDE**
This endorsement entitles the policyholder to reimbursement for emergency roadside services, including towing, jump starts, flat tire changes, and lockout assistance. Services must be initiated through the Insurance Megacorp Roadside Assistance line.

Your renewal premium shall not increase by more than 10% annually for a period of 3 years, provided there is no change in vehicle use, driver assignment, or claims history. Rate lock does not apply to fees, surcharges, or taxes.
